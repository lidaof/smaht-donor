Scientists in the SMaHT Project will learn about changes in our DNA that happen in different places in the body, including how these changes might accumulate as we age. This information will help us understand the human body and peopleâ€™s risk for diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Knowing more about these normal changes as we age will also lead to better early disease detection and treatment because understanding normal changes can help us know when changes are abnormal or risky. This project will create a much-needed resource of genetic data and tissues that will support many research studies in the future.
