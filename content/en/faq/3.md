We believe families everywhere will benefit from the project’s genetic and genomic discoveries, ultimately leading to new, life-saving treatments and disease prevention. Past genetic research has not always included many people from underrepresented groups, especially those most likely to experience health problems. Unfortunately, not representing people from all backgrounds and heritage can limit what populations benefit from a project. The SMaHT Network has a team of researchers focusing on the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of tissue donation for genetic research. One of the ELSI team’s goals is to support SMaHT in representing as many people as possible in tissue samples that are collected for the project. The ELSI team will address past research gaps using a unique approach called Diversity, is.
