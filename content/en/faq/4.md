SMaHT aims to advance genetic research in ways that benefit families everywhere, ultimately contributing to new treatments and disease prevention. Ensuring that research includes a broad range of participants helps maximize its impact and relevance. To support this effort, the ELSI team is using an approach called the integrated ELSI 360⁰ model, which involves working closely with community stakeholders and establishing Community Advisory Boards (CABs). These efforts are designed to support donor families as they consider whether to donate their loved ones' tissues to SMaHT and ensure the process is guided by transparency, respect, and ethical considerations.
