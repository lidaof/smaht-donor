The ELSI team is informed directly by families as part of the I-DECIDE project. The SMaHT project includes a team of researchers who are specifically interested in questions like:

* How do families decide whether or not to donate to a genetic study like SMaHT?
* How can we best support families while deciding whether to donate their loved oneâ€™s tissues for research?
* What are the best ways to support staff who meet with families to ask about donations?
