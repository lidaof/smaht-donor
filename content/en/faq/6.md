Scientists will analyze the donated tissues to determine the unique genetic makeup of the donor, including the non-inherited gene changes that could happen in some cells. That information will be stored in a genetic database. The large database will create a resource of non-inherited gene changes in several tissues across many individual donors.

Donated tissues will be physically stored in a Biobank which will preserve the samples of donated tissue from many people for use in current and future research. The Biobank will allow scientists to keep using the tissues in the future so that each donation has an even larger impact.
