The project makes every effort to ensure the confidentiality of the donor and his/her blood relatives. Safeguards include the following:

* Identifying information such as donorâ€™s name, address, date of birth, and medical record number are excluded from databases and are also not included in the way tissues are labeled.
* No researchers using the genetic databases or tissues in the Biobank will know the identity of the donor because the information and tissues will be labeled only with a unique code number.
* Researchers using the genetic databases and/or tissues in the Biobank must agree to never try to discover the identity of the donor.
