## The Scientific Research Team

The journey of groundbreaking research begins with the generosity of donors and their families that provide the invaluable gift of tissue donation. The SMaHT project is grateful to partner with several Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) that are essential for connecting donor families with this research opportunity. The OPOs involved in the SMaHT program are: ConnectLife, Gift of Life Donor Program, and LifeGift.
