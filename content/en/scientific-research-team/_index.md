## The Scientific Research Team

The SMaHT Network comprises several specialized teams working together to drive the project forward and achieve its mission. Each team plays a vital role, in securing the successful collection, analysis, and sharing of data. The Coordinating Center manages program activities and outreach, while the Tissue Procurement Center oversees the collection and distribution of donor tissues. Within this, the ELSI Team provides guidance on ethical, legal, and social considerations. The Technology and Tool Development Team focuses on advancing methods for detecting DNA changes, and the Genome Characterization Centers generate and analyze data from collected samples. Finally, the Data Analysis Center ensures that the resulting somatic variant catalog is high-quality, accessible, and valuable for the broader research community. Together, these teams collaborate to ensure that SMaHT’s efforts are integrated, efficient, and impactful in advancing our understanding of somatic mosaicism.

The journey of groundbreaking research begins with the generosity of donors and their families that provide the invaluable gift of tissue donation. The SMaHT project is grateful to partner with several Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) that are essential for connecting donor families with this research opportunity. The OPOs involved in the SMaHT program are: ConnectLife, Gift of Life Donor Program, and LifeGift.

{{< quote word="Gift of Life Donor Program has championed medical research and scientific discovery since the founding of our program nearly 50 years ago. We evaluate every organ and tissue donor as a potential donor for research and are proud to continue our decades-long partnership with NDRI as part of the SMaHT Network." name="CPTC, President and CEO of the Gift of Life Donor Program">}}

The extraordinary donations serve as the foundation for the many diverse research groups within the SMaHT project, fueling innovations that advance medical science. The SMaHT research team includes over 200 members from across the United States. Explore the graphic below to learn more about the different types of centers and groups that make up the SMaHT Scientific Team.

{{< quote word="For more than 25 years, ConnectLife has been committed to helping donors and their families leave a meaningful legacy through donation to research with NDRI. We are thrilled to be part of the Somatic Mosaicism Across Human Tissues project and have high hopes that we can continue to play a role in investigating new treatments and cures for an array of diseases" name="Kevin Gramlich CEO of ConnectLife">}}
